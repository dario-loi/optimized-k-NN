# optimized_kNN

In this repo, I'm making the fastest implementation of k-NN I can manage to code.
NumPy has been used to make things faster since it's coded in C.

# How to use it

To test this repo, you can easily clone it and run test.py directly.

# NumPy files

I decided to include the NumPy files needed by the algorithm directly in the repo, even though they're pretty heavy (the one for training images is ~47MB!).
I also included the create_arrays file that can be run to generate the necessary files starting from the MNIST datasets.
